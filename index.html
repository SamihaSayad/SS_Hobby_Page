    <p style="color:darkgreen;font-family:MV Boli;font-size:20px;text-align:left">Jewels were always there and the
        purpose of wearing them always remained the same, like showing people wealth, symbols that had to do with
        religion or politic, or to express feeling to somebody by having their name engraved. The thing that has changed
        throughout the time is the materials used to make the jewelry. Here were going to talk about Jewelry making in

    <p class="double" style="color:rgba(153, 0, 255, 0.801);font-family:Algerian;font-size:18px"> In the past jewelty making went through four
        stages.
        The first Known jewelry found was in africa. It was made from shells and ostrich eggs. Then it wasn't until 3000
        BC in Ancient Egypt when they started to make gold jewelry.After that came the Roman jewelry. Beside the gold
        they used sapphiers, emeralds and amber. Then in the middle ages they started to put jewelry on the clothes and
        the rings were popular at that time. The last stage was in the 19th century when they started using precious
        stones and matching suites. </P>

    <p style="color:rgb(89, 0, 255);font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:18px"><img src="Images/pic 5.jpg" id="imageLeft1"> Jewelry used to be just eanrings, rings, bracelets, and necklaces.
      Now there are much more to it. The designers now must creat timeless designes that looks modern enough to be 
      used. They have to renew there their collection every sesone.

      In the mid 20s Jewelry makers started to use plastic in their designs and 
	  they were called "Junk Jewelry". They could mold and sharpen it which made 
	  it easy to use and cheep.

    <h3 style="color:darkred;font-family:Arial;font-size:24px">Jewelry Making in the Future </h3>

    <p style="color:purple;font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:18px"> In the twenty-first century people had the power
        to design their own jewelry and what differentiate one from another is 
		the taste of someone or the occasion. A piece of jewelry can represent 
		the persone who is wearing it.

    <div id="future">
    <p style="font-family:Times New Roman;font-size:18px"> The future of the jewelry expected to take a
        total turn around with the use of the 3D printing. With the 3D printing we can create identical replicas models.
        We can print gold or any other precious metal into a mold that been uploded and the jewelry will come out
        perfect. The 3D printer can make more complecated designs and higher quality products that can't be dome with. You can read
